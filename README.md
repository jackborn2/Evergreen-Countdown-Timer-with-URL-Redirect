# **Evergreen Countdown Timer with URL Redirect (Build Your Own in 2025)**

Have you ever felt the pressure of a countdown timer ticking down, pushing you to take action before a deal disappears?

That’s no accident.

**Marketers use countdown timers to create urgency**, and it works. According to a report by HubSpot, **adding urgency can increase conversions by up to 332%**. But here’s the problem: most countdown timers expire for everyone at the same time.

That’s where an **Evergreen Countdown Timer** comes in. Unlike fixed deadlines, **evergreen timers are personalized for every visitor**. And in this article, you’ll learn exactly how to build your own timer that not only counts down — but also **redirects users when time is up**.

No expensive software. No fancy tools. Just **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🚀 What Is an Evergreen Countdown Timer with Redirect?

Let’s say you send a visitor to your special offer page. As soon as they land, their **3-day timer** starts counting down — just for them. After those 3 days, if they visit the page again, **they’re automatically redirected** to a full-price page or an expired offer message.

This is exactly how platforms like **Deadline Funnel** work. But instead of paying \$49/month or more, **you can build this feature yourself** for free.

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn in This Guide

You’ll learn how to:

* Create a **real-time countdown timer** using JavaScript
* **Track user deadlines** using localStorage (so it’s unique for each visitor)
* Automatically **redirect users** to a new page when the countdown ends
* Make your timer look stylish and modern
* Bonus: make the timer customizable using query strings (like `?deadline=...`)

## 🛠️ Tools You’ll Need

Here’s the good news: no backend is required. We’re keeping it simple.

* **HTML** – for the page structure
* **CSS** – to style the countdown
* **JavaScript** – to calculate time and redirect users
* *(Optional)* Node.js – if you want advanced user tracking

## 🏗️ Let’s Start Building

### Step 1: Basic HTML Page

Create an `index.html` file and paste this code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>Evergreen Countdown Timer</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Special Offer Ends In:</h1>
    <div id="countdown">
      <span id="days">00</span> days
      <span id="hours">00</span> hours
      <span id="minutes">00</span> minutes
      <span id="seconds">00</span> seconds
    </div>
  </div>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

---

### Step 2: Add CSS Styling

In a new file called `style.css`, add:

```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 50px;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
}

.container {
  max-width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background: #fff;
  padding: 30px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

#countdown span {
  font-size: 2rem;
  color: #e63946;
  margin: 0 10px;
}
```

---

### Step 3: Add the JavaScript Logic

Now, create a file `script.js`:

```javascript
// Set deadline in localStorage
const timerDurationInDays = 3;
const redirectUrl = "https://yourdomain.com/expired"; // Change this

const now = new Date();
let deadline = localStorage.getItem("evergreenDeadline");

if (!deadline) {
  const expireDate = new Date(now.getTime() + timerDurationInDays * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  localStorage.setItem("evergreenDeadline", expireDate);
  deadline = expireDate;
}

deadline = new Date(deadline);

function updateCountdown() {
  const currentTime = new Date();
  const timeLeft = deadline - currentTime;

  if (timeLeft <= 0) {
    window.location.href = redirectUrl;
    return;
  }

  const days = Math.floor(timeLeft / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  const hours = Math.floor((timeLeft / (1000 * 60 * 60)) % 24);
  const minutes = Math.floor((timeLeft / 1000 / 60) % 60);
  const seconds = Math.floor((timeLeft / 1000) % 60);

  document.getElementById("days").textContent = String(days).padStart(2, '0');
  document.getElementById("hours").textContent = String(hours).padStart(2, '0');
  document.getElementById("minutes").textContent = String(minutes).padStart(2, '0');
  document.getElementById("seconds").textContent = String(seconds).padStart(2, '0');
}

setInterval(updateCountdown, 1000);
updateCountdown();
```

## 🧠 How This Works

* When a user visits your page for the first time, a deadline is created and saved in their browser.
* Every second, the countdown updates.
* When the time hits zero, they are redirected to a new page.
* Even if they close and reopen the tab, the deadline stays the same — because it’s stored in `localStorage`.

---

## 🌐 Optional: Use URL Parameters for Flexibility

Want to control the deadline via email or link? You can use a timestamp like:

```
https://yourdomain.com/?deadline=1721122200000
```

Update your JS to check if the URL has a `deadline` parameter. If yes, use that value instead of localStorage.

## 📊 Why This Matters in Real-World Marketing

Creating **personalized urgency** helps drive action. Many visitors bounce off your page thinking, “I’ll come back later.” But when you show a **real timer that actually expires**, your conversion rates go up.

Tools like Deadline Funnel charge you a **monthly fee**, but this simple script gives you 80% of the functionality — for free.

---

## ✅ Where to Use This Timer

* On **course sales pages**
* On **eCommerce product offers**
* In **email campaigns** (link to countdown page)
* On **webinar replays** with a 24-hour watch window

---

## 🔐 Limitations (And How to Improve It)

This basic version uses `localStorage`, which means:

* If the user clears their browser data, the timer resets
* If they open incognito mode, the timer starts over

**Advanced idea**: add a Node.js backend with a unique user ID to store the deadline securely in a database.


## 💡 Final Thoughts

In marketing, **every second matters**. This project gives you a free, flexible way to turn passive visitors into paying customers by creating real urgency.

It’s easy to build, lightweight to run, and 100% under your control.

Give it a try. Set it up on your next landing page. You’ll be surprised at how much difference **a ticking clock** can make.
